# Get-EnphaseData.py
A custom sensor for PRTG that queries your on-site Enphase solar controller, the Envoy.

This version is specific to v5 firmware. If you've been updated to v7, you'll want [this script](https://github.com/greiginsydney/Get-EnphaseData-v7.py) instead.

See [greiginsydney.com/get-enphasedata-py](https://greiginsydney.com/get-enphasedata-py) for the story...

Problems with the script? Please open a new Issue on the tab above.
